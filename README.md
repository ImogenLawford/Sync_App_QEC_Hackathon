# Sync_App_QEC_Hackathon
Sync is an app provides you with a personalized multi-media library of recommendations for playlists, movies, tv shows, podcasts and music based on your book preferences. 

Much like an instagram app, users scroll through different book titles to 'like' or 'dislike' them. Based on favourite items, Sync's algorithm provides recommendations for similar media types within the same theme, time period, and emotional response to create a personalized media library at your fingertips in just a few seconds.

This project was awarded second place in the Queen's University Engineering Competition for Programming.
